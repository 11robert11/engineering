<h3>I am a junior at Crescenta Valley high school. I enjoy lots of things such as playing tennis, listening to music, and decorating.<hr></h3>
    <h3>Today we all played a name game<br> and I had to recite 36 names and facts.</h3>
    <p>Hi, this is friday August 26th and today we did a challenge with a marble. We had nine pipes and had to connect them together in order to get the marble into the bucket.
    It was surprisingly difficult because we had to constantly move around and pass along the pipes, but we eventually got it and did well.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d020hcWA_Wg">favorite song</a><p>This week I learned a lot of stuff. On Wednesday we started using Tinkercad and It is very difficult to use, but I think I'm staring to get the hang of it. Today(friday) we did a challenge. We had to bring an object from home and then make it in tinkercad. This took a while to do but I am pretty happy with my results.</p>
    
    <p>Today on Semptember 14th, we worked on our Rube Goldberg machine. My group and I finished our ramp with the incline. We also got to finish the pulley on top of the incline. So far
    we have not runinto any problems and I am happy with how it looks. Today September 16th we did a challenge with  a paper boat. My groupś boat failed miserably. We should have explanded the 
    surface area of the boat. Instead we put it in the water and it sank immediatly. </p>
