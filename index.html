<h3>I am a junior at Crescenta Valley high school. I enjoy lots of things such as playing tennis, listening to music, and decorating.<hr></h3>
    <h3>Today we all played a name game<br> and I had to recite 36 names and facts.</h3>
    <p><u>Week 2!</u> Hi, this is friday August 26th and today we did a challenge with a marble. We had nine pipes and had to connect them together in order to get the marble into the bucket.
    It was surprisingly difficult because we had to constantly move around and pass along the pipes, but we eventually got it and did well.</p>

On Wednesday we started using Tinkercad and It is very difficult to use, but I think I'm staring to get the hang of it. Today(friday) we did a challenge. We had to bring an object from home and then make it in tinkercad. This took a while to do but I am pretty happy with my results.</p>
    
    <p><u>Week 4!</u>Today on Semptember 14th, we worked on our Rube Goldberg machine. My group and I finished our ramp with the incline. We also got to finish the pulley on top of the incline. So far
    we have not run into any problems and I am happy with how it looks. Today September 16th we did a challenge with  a paper boat. My groups boat failed miserably. We should have explanded the 
    surface area of the boat. Instead we put it in the water and it sank immediatly. </p>

    <p><u>Week 5!</u> This week we mostly worked on our Rube Goldberg project. On monday we got a lot of work done on our machine. Our whole incline ramp a well as the pulley was completed that day.
    Then, on wednesday we got to work some more on it. After our final adjustments, we got to testing. Our balloon thankfully popped after the first try. Our car that was pushed by the baseball rolled 
    very slowly but either way it worked out. Today(friday) more groups are testing their machines and we get to watch all the creative projects made.</p>
